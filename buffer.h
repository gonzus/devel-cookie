/*
 * An implementation of a byte buffer with the following characteristics:
 *
 * + Can be used to wrap an existing char* and give it the semantics of
 *   a buffer.
 * + Can be used a a newly allocated memory buffer; if the needed size is
 *   small (see below), it will use a stack array and will not allocate
 *   any memory.
 * + Can grow as needed, using realloc (and moving the data from the stack
 *   array if needed).
 * + Keeps track separately of a reading position and a writing position within
 *   the buffer data.

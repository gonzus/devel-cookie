            * Since upgrading Devel::PPPort did not fix the errors,
              switch from using av_top_index / av_tindex to using
              av_shift, which seems to be supported waaay back.

            * Upgrade Devel::PPPort to version 3.36 to solve
              compilation errors on older versions of Perl.

0.000018    2018-03-09
            * Try to sidestep a compilation failure for older Perls
              by switching from av_top_index to av_tindex.
            * Change the code to avoid, as far as I can see,
              anything that might trigger an older C compiler.
              Because it has only been 25 years since C90...

            * Optionally accept names without values, by adding
              an optional parameter to crush_cookie that allows
              the caller to say "please give me names without
              a value, and set them to undef".  The default value
              is zero, so you will not get these valueless names.
            * Rework Buffer implementation,
            * We now accept a cookie with a value that is an arrayref.
              The values in the array get joined with '&', and then
              the whole string is URL-encoded.  When crushing such a
              cookie, the reverse applies.  This was suggested by
              James Raspass (JRaspass in github); thanks!

              CamelCase, in accordance to RFC6265. Thanks to
              @SysPete for the error report.

              @SysPete and @veryrusty for the error report
              and confirming what the proper behaviour is.
            * Add some more test cases.
